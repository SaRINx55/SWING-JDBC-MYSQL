use Work;
create table Student(id int primary key, fname varchar(20) not null, lname varchar(20), age int not null);

--create a user that has insert, update, delete and select privileges...
select privilege is required for umdate and delete.
in update, any change is done w.r.t the primary key. hence, select privilege selects the row with p.k = required
similar for delete
